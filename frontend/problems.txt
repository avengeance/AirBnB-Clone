When testing the Signup form page, the next state in the console was displaying
everything but, createdAt and updatedAt

This is what needed to show:
{
  session: {
    user: {
      createdAt: "<Some date time format>",
      email: "<new email>",
      id: "<new id>",
      updatedAt: "<Some date time format>",
      username: "<new password>",
      firstName: "<new first name>",
      lastName: "<new last name>",
    }
  }
}
